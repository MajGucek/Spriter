# Spriter

Tool for creating sprites for my [`Party Games`](https://github.com/MajGucek/PartyGames) Java project.

Spriter allows you to create sprites with multiple frames of fixed width and height.  
Supports creating, loading, and exporting sprites in both **binary** and **JSON** formats.

**Look in the Releases section for the executable.**
